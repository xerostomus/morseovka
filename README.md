Program to learn morse code written in Bash

At the time present it is written in Czech language as it is intended for my children and their friend. Occasionally I will translate it into English - if anybody is interested. 

The main idea: The sound of morse code is created via command sox according to a script, then it is replayed, so it sounds good despite it is created in Bash. 

I am fully aware that it would be better to write it in Python, but I have started in Bash as I thought that it will be short, but it has grown in this tremendous file.
